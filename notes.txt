O(n^2) Sorting.cs
O(n)
O(n^2)
O(n)

Prediction:
Sort1 is O(n) so it will have linear performance to it's input
Sort2 is O(log n) so it will perform much faster

Create a For loop that increments in 1 each iteration.
Multiply the number for each increment. Condition to stop if greater than length minus 1.

var array = new double[length - 1];
        for (double i = 1; i <= length; i++){
            double multiple = number * i;
            int index = (int)(i-1);
            array[index] = multiple;
        }
var multiples = int[6];
For (i = 1; i <= length.Length; i++){
    multiple = number * i; 
    multiples.Add[multiple]
}


RotateListRight

This is essentially pushing and array to the right. So all we need to do is to create a new list that has the same size. Populate that list with the proper or needed / requested order. 

So 1 2 3 4 5 6 let's say i have to create a new array

new <List>[9]

For loop? 

Pushing 3

index 0 + 3 = index 3
0 3
1 4
2 5
3 6
4 7
5 8
6 9

if new index is > size

6 10
then 10 - size = 1
6 1
7 2
8 3

For (int iteration = 0; iteration <= size; iteration++){
    if (list + moveAmount <= size){
        new List.Add[list[1 + moveAmount]]
    }
    else if{
        new List.Add[list[1 + moveAmount - size]]
}


Create a new empty list,

Instructions
This assignment is meant to simulate the kind of question you might receive in a job interview. It is important for you to understand the problem, develop a quality solution, and communicate it in a clear and professional manner.

You will need to record and upload a short video with your response to the question below. When making your video, please remember the following:

Show your your face.
Speak clearly.
The video should be less than 3 minutes.
The video should be uploaded as a public, but unlisted video, so the grader can see it without permissions.
Questions
In your video, provide a response to each of the following questions:

What is an advantage of dynamic arrays compared to traditional, static arrays?
